//This guide describes the sequence to be done for testing my scripts
*******************************************************************************************************
1. Before testing the submitting scripts, make sure that Mongodb server is up and running.
2. the apache and Php must be installed on your machine and should be up and running
3. More important point is you don't have to create a new database, because I have used the default 
test database.
4.For adding new tag and comment from the GUI, you need to launch the html files first, otherwise you will 
insert empty value to the table.
